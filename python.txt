#2 paying when using youtube API
Free Tier

Google Cloud Platform offers a free tier for new users, which includes:

100,000 API requests per day
100 hours of video uploads per day
100 hours of live streaming per day
1 TB of data storage per month
If you stay within these limits, you won't incur any costs.

#3 practical calc youtube API
To give you a better estimate, here's a rough breakdown of the number of API requests you might need to make to retrieve all the comments and replies:

144 comments / 100 comments per API request = 1.44 API requests (round up to 2 API requests to be safe)
Assuming each comment has an average of 1-2 replies, you might need to make an additional 1-2 API requests to retrieve all the replies
So, in total, you might need to make around 3-4 API requests to retrieve all the comments and replies. This should be well within the free tier limits of 100,000 API requests per day.
